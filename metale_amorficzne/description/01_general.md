The purpose of this study is to develop an _Amorphous Metals Analyzer_
specifically designed for researchers at Wroclaw University of Science and
Technology. This analyzer aims to enhance the precision and efficiency of
evaluating produced amorphous materials. By utilizing this tool, researchers can
obtain more accurate and faster results regarding the number and properties of
phases present in a given amorphous metal sample.

### Integration with Nanoindention Machine

The Amorphous Metals Analyzer is integrated with a nanoindention machine, which
is capable of measuring various mechanical properties of the sample. The results
obtained from the nanoindention machine are fed into the analyzer, allowing for
a comprehensive analysis of the material.

### Clustering of Metal Phases and Calculation of Mechanical Properties

Once the data from the nanoindention machine is inputted into the analyzer, the
application performs clustering of the different metal phases present in the
sample.

Furthermore, the Amorphous Metals Analyzer calculates key mechanical properties
for each phase identified. These mechanical properties help researchers assess
the quality and performance of the amorphous metal, providing valuable insights
for further analysis and experimentation.

Overall, the Amorphous Metals Analyzer serves as a tool for researchers at

### What are amorphous metals?

Amorphous metal also known as metallic glass or glassy metal is a solid metallic
material, usually an alloy, with disordered atomic-scale structure.

Most metals are crystalline in their solid state, which means they have a highly
ordered arrangement of atoms. Amorphous metals are non-crystalline, and have a
glass-like structure. But unlike common glasses, such as window glass, which are
typically electrical insulators, amorphous metals have good electrical
conductivity and can show metallic luster.

Amorphous metal is usually an alloy rather than a pure metal. The alloys contain
atoms of significantly different sizes, leading to low free volume (and
therefore up to orders of magnitude higher viscosity than other metals and
alloys) in molten state. The viscosity prevents the atoms moving enough to form
an ordered lattice. The material structure also results in low shrinkage during
cooling, and resistance to plastic deformation. The absence of grain boundaries,
the weak spots of crystalline materials, leads to better resistance to wear and
corrosion. Amorphous metals, while technically glasses, are also much tougher
and less brittle than oxide glasses and ceramics. Amorphous metals can be
grouped in two categories, as either non-ferromagnetic, if they are composed of
Ln, Mg, Zr, Ti, Pd, Ca, Cu, Pt and Au, or ferromagnetic alloys, if they are
composed of Fe, Co, and Ni.

The alloys of boron, silicon, phosphorus, and other glass formers with magnetic
metals (iron, cobalt, nickel) have high magnetic susceptibility, with low
coercivity and high electrical resistance. Usually the electrical conductivity
of a metallic glass is of the same low order of magnitude as of a molten metal
just above the melting point. The high resistance leads to low losses by eddy
currents when subjected to alternating magnetic fields, a property useful for
e.g. transformer magnetic cores. Their low coercivity also contributes to low
loss.

Amorphous metals have higher tensile yield strengths and higher elastic strain
limits than polycrystalline metal alloys, but their ductilities and fatigue
strengths are lower. Amorphous alloys have a variety of potentially useful
properties. In particular, they tend to be stronger than crystalline alloys of
similar chemical composition, and they can sustain larger reversible ("elastic")
deformations than crystalline alloys. Amorphous metals derive their strength
directly from their non-crystalline structure, which does not have any of the
defects (such as dislocations) that limit the strength of crystalline alloys.
One modern amorphous metal, known as Vitreloy, has a tensile strength that is
almost twice that of high-grade titanium. However, metallic glasses at room
temperature are not ductile and tend to fail suddenly when loaded in tension,
which limits the material applicability in reliability-critical applications, as
the impending failure is not evident. Therefore, there is considerable interest
in producing metal matrix composites consisting of a metallic glass matrix
containing dendritic particles or fibers of a ductile crystalline metal.

Perhaps the most useful property of bulk amorphous alloys is that they are true
glasses, which means that they soften and flow upon heating. This allows for
easy processing, such as by injection molding, in much the same way as polymers.
As a result, amorphous alloys have been commercialized for use in sports
equipment, medical devices, and as cases for electronic equipment.

### Usage of amorphous metals

#### Commercial

Currently the most important application is due to the special magnetic
properties of some ferromagnetic metallic glasses. The low magnetization loss is
used in high efficiency transformers (amorphous metal transformer) at line
frequency and some higher frequency transformers. Amorphous steel is a very
brittle material which makes it difficult to punch into motor laminations. Also
electronic article surveillance (such as theft control passive ID tags) often
uses metallic glasses because of these magnetic properties.

A commercial amorphous alloy, Vitreloy 1 (41.2% Zr, 13.8% Ti, 12.5% Cu, 10% Ni,
and 22.5% Be), was developed at Caltech, as a part of Department of Energy and
NASA research of new aerospace materials.

Ti-based metallic glass, when made into thin pipes, have a high tensile strength
of 2,100 MPa (300 ksi), elastic elongation of 2% and high corrosion resistance.
Using these properties, a Ti–Zr–Cu–Ni–Sn metallic glass was used to improve the
sensitivity of a Coriolis flow meter. This flow meter is about 28-53 times more
sensitive than conventional meters, which can be applied in fossil-fuel,
chemical, environmental, semiconductor and medical science industry.

Zr-Al-Ni-Cu based metallic glass can be shaped into 2.2 to 5 by 4 mm (0.087 to
0.197 by 0.157 in) pressure sensors for automobile and other industries, and
these sensors are smaller, more sensitive, and possess greater pressure
endurance compared to conventional stainless steel made from cold working.

#### Potential

Amorphous metals exhibit unique softening behavior above their glass transition
and this softening has been increasingly explored for thermoplastic forming of
metallic glasses. Such low softening temperature allows for developing
simple methods for making composites of nanoparticles (e.g. carbon nanotubes)
and bulk metallic glasses. It has been shown that metallic glasses can be
patterned on extremely small length scales ranging from 10 nm to several
millimeters. This may solve the problems of nanoimprint lithography where
expensive nano-molds made of silicon break easily. Nano-molds made from metallic
glasses are easy to fabricate and more durable than silicon molds. The superior
electronic, thermal and mechanical properties of bulk metallic glasses compared
to polymers make them a good option for developing nanocomposites for electronic
application such as field electron emission devices.

Ti<sub>40</sub>Cu<sub>36</sub>Pd<sub>14</sub>Zr<sub>10</sub> is believed to be
noncarcinogenic, is about three times stronger than titanium, and its elastic
modulus nearly matches bones. It has a high wear resistance and does not produce
abrasion powder. The alloy does not undergo shrinkage on solidification. A
surface structure can be generated that is biologically attachable by surface
modification using laser pulses, allowing better joining with bone.

Mg<sub>60</sub>Zn<sub>35</sub>Ca<sub>5</sub>, rapidly cooled to achieve
amorphous structure, is being investigated at Lehigh University as a biomaterial
for implantation into bones as screws, pins, or plates, to fix fractures. Unlike
traditional steel or titanium, this material dissolves in organisms at a rate of
roughly 1 millimeter per month and is replaced with bone tissue. This speed can
be adjusted by varying the content of zinc.

Bulk metallic glasses also seem to exhibit superior properties like SAM2X5-630
which has the highest recorded elastic limit for any steel alloy, according to
the researcher, essentially it has the highest threshold limit at which a
material can withstand an impact without deforming permanently (plasticity). The
alloy can withstand pressure and stress of up to 12.5 GPa (123,000 atm) without
undergoing any permanent deformation, this is the highest impact resistance of
any bulk metallic glass ever recorded (as of 2016). This makes it as an
attractive option for Armour material and other applications which requires high
stress tolerance. Additive manufacturing One challenge when synthesising a
metallic glass is that the techniques often only produce very small samples, due
to the need for high cooling rates. 3D-printing methods have been suggested as a
method to create larger bulk samples. Selective laser melting (SLM) is one
example of an additive manufacturing method that has been used to make iron
based metallic glasses. Laser foil printing (LFP) is another method where foils
of the amorphous metals are stacked and welded together, layer by layer.

### What is nanoindentation?

In an indentation test, a hard tip whose mechanical properties are known
(frequently made of a very hard material like diamond) is pressed into a sample
whose properties are unknown. The load placed on the indenter tip is increased
as the tip penetrates further into the specimen and soon reaches a user-defined
value. At this point, the load may be held constant for a period or removed. The
area of the residual indentation in the sample is measured and the hardness,
$H$, is defined as the maximum load, $P_{\mathrm{max}}$, divided by the residual
indentation area, $A_{\mathrm{r}}$:

Since the mid-1970s nanoindentation has become the primary method for measuring
and testing very small volumes of mechanical properties. Nanoindentation, also
called depth sensing indentation or instrumented indentation, gained popularity
with the development of machines that could record small load and displacement
with high accuracy and precision. The load displacement data can be used
to determine modulus of elasticity, hardness, yield strength, fracture
toughness, scratch hardness and wear properties.

In nanoindentation small loads and tip sizes are used, so the indentation area
may only be a few square micrometres or even nanometres. This presents problems
in determining the hardness, as the contact area is not easily found. Atomic
force microscopy or scanning electron microscopy techniques may be utilized to
image the indentation, but can be quite cumbersome. Instead, an indenter with a
geometry known to high precision (usually a Berkovich tip, which has a
three-sided pyramid geometry) is employed. During the course of the instrumented
indentation process, a record of the depth of penetration is made, and then the
area of the indent is determined using the known geometry of the indentation
tip. While indenting, various parameters such as load and depth of penetration
can be measured. A record of these values can be plotted on a graph to create a
load-displacement curve (such as the one shown in the figure below). These
curves can be used to extract mechanical properties of the material.
