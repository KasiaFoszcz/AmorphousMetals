# Discussion

In conclusion, the Metal Phases Analyzer has proved to be successful.
Hierarchical clustering emerged as the most accurate method, followed by k-means
clustering which also demonstrated good performance. One notable advantage of
k-means clustering is the ability to manually choose clustering starting points,
providing researchers with more control over the analysis.

OPTICS and ChatGPT did not yield satisfactory levels of accuracy in this
specific study. This highlights the importance of selecting appropriate
clustering methods that are well-suited for the given dataset and research
objectives.

Overall, the tool utilized in this research successfully fulfills its purpose by
delivering more accurate and efficient results related to the identification and
characterization of phases in a metal sample. This tool empowers researchers
with the means to gain deeper insights into the number and properties of phases
present, thereby contributing to advancements in the field.
